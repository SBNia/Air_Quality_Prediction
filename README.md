# Air_Quality_Prediction
In this problem, we seek to understand changes in air quality in Singapore from 2016 to 2019.
The data is about the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), specifically pm2.5. There are four bands on the PM2.5 concentration scale: 
0 to 55 for normal, 56 to 150 for elevated, 151 to 250 for high, and very high for any higher readings.
